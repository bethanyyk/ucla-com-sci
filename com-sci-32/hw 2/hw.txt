The two algorithms differ from each other in that stacks pop the item that was pushed to the stack most recently, while queues pop the item that was pushed to the queue the least recently. As a result, the stack-based implementation will search as far as possible in one direction before searching the other directions, while the queue-based implementation will explore all the spots at the current distance from the starting position in all directions before moving to the next distance.
