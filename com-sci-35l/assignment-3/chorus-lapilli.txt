Building off of the React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial (Before "Adding time travel")
1. Track the number of pieces each player has placed.
2. If three pieces have already been placed, the player will have to select an existing piece and move it to an adjacent empty square.
	a. Keep track of the selected piece to move using a state variable called movingSquare. It is set to null initially. When a player has to move a existing piece, it updates to the index of the selected piece.
	b. Create a helper function called calculateMovable to check if a selected piece can be moved to another square.
		i. Check if the move is to an adjacent empty square.
		ii. If the player has a piece in the center, they must vacate the center or make a winning move.
	c. Update handleClick to handle moves after each player places three pieces on the board using the helper function.
