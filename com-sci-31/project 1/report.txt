In step 5, I tried 25 and 10 for the Democrats and Republicans respectively, and got the expected result that Democrats would control the Senate.
Then, I tried 36 and 0 for the Democrats and Republicans respectively, and got the expected result that Democrats would control the Senate, but I also got a message saying that something looked awry with my numbers.

In the logic_error.cpp file, I changed the >= in line 31 to <=. By doing this, the program would return the opposite from what you would expect.
If you inputted 25 and 10 for the Democrats and Republicans respectively, it would say that the Republicans would control the Senate instead of the Democrats.
The compiler said there were no issues found, and all of my test cases gave the results they were supposed to.

In the compile_error.cpp file, I added extra white space in between the << in line 20.
This resulted in the compiler saying there were 2 errors (E0029: expected an expression. C2059: syntax error: '<'). The program would not run at all.
