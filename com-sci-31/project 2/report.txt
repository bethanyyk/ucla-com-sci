Notable Obstacles
- I was getting invalids for the yes/no questions when using || to connect my conditions in my if statements.
  I corrected this issue by changing the connector to &&.
- I was having trouble getting it to print the recommendation result to a single decimal place when using ints to store all of the variables.
  I corrected this issue by changing the datatypes for actor, thumbsUp, and thumbsDown to doubles so that my final calculation would result in a double.
  I also had to use the magic formula to get it to display .0 because C++ knows .0 is not a meaningful part of the number.

Test Cases:
- Titanic, 10, Yes, 10, Yes, No
- Titanic, 1, No, 1, No, Yes
- CodeBoard

- Harry Potter, 10, Yes, 10, Yes, No (Testing title that is more than one word long)

- , 11 (Testing theme value outside of the range)
- , 5, Yes No (Testing invalid actor value)
- , 5, Yes, 0 (Testing taste value outside of the range)
- , 5, Yes, 11 (Testing taste value outside of the range)
- , 5, Yes, 5, Yes No (Testing invalid thumbsUp value)
