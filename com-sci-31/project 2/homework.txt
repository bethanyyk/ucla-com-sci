1. What is the output produced by the following program segment? Don't just run it — trace through it and figure it out by hand (which is a skill you'll need for the exams).

  string endline = "endl";
  cout << "endl";
  cout << endline;
  cout << endl;
  cout << "endline";


  endlendl
  endline



2. Consider the following program:

  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
    int len;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> len;

    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
    {
      for (int j = i+1; j < len; j++)
      {
        cout << " ";
      }
      cout << "#" << endl;
    }
    return( 0 );
  }

In a brief, simple English sentence, state what this program does (e.g. "It prints a picture of an aqueduct."). Again, figure this out by hand.


  Creates (len) lines with a # in each line.
  The # in the first line is in the (len) position, the # in the second line is in the (len - 1) position, the # in the third line in the (len - 2) position, ...
	


3. Copy the program in problem 2 and change it so that for any input number, the changed program produces exactly the same output as the original, but the changed program uses a while loop instead of a for loop for the inner loop.


  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;

  int main()
  {
    int len;
    int j;
	
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> len;
	
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++)
    {
      j = i + 1;
      while (j < len)
      {
        cout << " ";
  	j++;
      }
      cout << "#" << endl;
    }
    return(0);
  }



4. Copy the program you wrote for problem 3 and change it so that for any input number, it produces exactly the same output as the original, but uses a do-while loop instead of a for loop for the outer loop. Be careful! (Hint: How does it behave if len is not positive?) You may need to add a little additional code to make sure the program behaves identically to the program in problem 3.

  #include <iostream>
  using namespace std;
	
  int main()
  {
    int len;
    int i = 0;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> len;

    do
    {
      if (len < 1)
      {
        return (0);
      }
			
      for (int j = i + 1; j < len; j++)
      {
        cout << " ";
      }
      cout << "#" << endl;
      i++;
    } while (i < len);
	
    return(0);
  }



5. Assume weekday has been previously declared as an int and given a meaningful value. Write a switch statement that for any value of weekday, produces exactly the same output as the following if statement.

  if (weekday == 1)
      cout << "rainy days and mondays get me down";
  else if (weekday == 2)
      cout << "ruby tuesday";
  else if (weekday == 6 || weekday == 7)
      cout << "wonderful weekend";
  else
      cout << "regular day";


    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
	
    int main()
    {
      int weekday;
	
      cout << "Enter a number: ";
      cin >> weekday;
	
      switch (weekday)
      {
        case 1:
          cout << "rainy days and mondays get me down";
          break;
        case 2:
          cout << "ruby tuesday";
          break;
        case 6:
        case 7:
          cout << "wonderful weekend";
          break;
        default:
        cout << "regular day";
      }
	
      return(0);
    }
